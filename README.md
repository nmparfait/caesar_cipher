caesar cipher project built with python
The Caesar Cipher, also known as a shift cipher, 
is one of the oldest and simplest forms of encrypting a message. 
It is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in 
the original message (which in cryptography is called the plaintext) 
is replaced with a letter corresponding to a certain number of letters 
shifted up or down in the alphabet.

For each letter of the alphabet, you would take its position in the alphabet, 
say 3 for the letter ‘C’, and shift it by the key number. 
If we had a key of +3, that ‘C’ would be shifted down to 
an ‘F’ – and that same process would be applied to every letter in the plaintext.

In this way, a message that initially was quite readable, 
ends up in a form that cannot be understood at a simple glance.
